# Vercel Deployment Guide for Health and Wellness App

This guide will walk you through deploying your health and wellness app to Vercel's platform, which offers free hosting for personal projects.

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Vercel account (can be created with GitHub)
- Your health-wellness-app code

## Step 1: Create a Git Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "health-wellness-app")
4. Choose visibility (public or private)
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/health-wellness-app

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Add remote repository (replace with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/health-wellness-app.git

# Push code
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and sign up/sign in (use GitHub for easier integration)
2. From the dashboard, click "Add New..." → "Project"

   - Root directory: ./
   - Build command: next build
   - Output directory: .next
5. Click "Deploy"

## Step 4: Access Your Deployed App

Once deployment is complete, Vercel will provide you with a URL (e.g., health-wellness-app.vercel.app) where your app is permanently accessible.

## Step 5: Set Up Custom Domain (Optional)

1. From your project dashboard, go to "Settings" → "Domains"
2. Add your custom domain
