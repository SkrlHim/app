# App Architecture

## Overview
The Health and Wellness App follows a modern web application architecture using Next.js framework with Cloudflare Workers for deployment. The application is structured to support user authentication, calorie tracking, workout recommendations, and diet planning.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Presentation Layer
- **Next.js Pages**: Handles routing and server-side rendering
- **React Components**: Reusable UI components
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling framework

### 2. Application Layer
- **API Routes**: RESTful endpoints for data operations
- **Services**: Business logic implementation
- **Hooks**: Custom React hooks for state management and data fetching

### 3. Data Layer
- **Models**: Database schema definitions and data access methods
- **D1 Database**: SQL database provided by Cloudflare
- **External APIs**: Integration with food and exercise databases

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/auth/session` - Get current session

### User Profile
- `GET /api/users/profile` - Get user profile
- `PUT /api/users/profile` - Update user profile
- `POST /api/users/goals` - Set user goals
- `GET /api/users/progress` - Get user progress

### Calorie Tracking
- `GET /api/food/search` - Search food database
- `POST /api/food/custom` - Add custom food
- `GET /api/meals` - Get user meals
- `POST /api/meals` - Log new meal
- `PUT /api/meals/:id` - Update meal
- `DELETE /api/meals/:id` - Delete meal
- `GET /api/calories/summary` - Get calorie summary

### Workout Management
- `GET /api/exercises` - Get exercises list
- `GET /api/exercises/:id` - Get exercise details
- `GET /api/workouts/plans` - Get workout plans
- `GET /api/workouts/plans/:id` - Get workout plan details

## Data Flow

1. **User Registration and Profile Setup**:
   - User registers → Creates profile → Sets goals
   - System calculates initial calorie targets and recommends workout/diet plans

2. **Daily Calorie Tracking**:
   - User logs meals → System calculates nutritional totals
   - System compares to daily targets → Updates progress

3. **Workout Recommendations**:
   - Based on user goals and profile → System recommends workout plans
   - User logs completed workouts → System tracks progress

4. **Diet Planning**:
   - Based on user goals and preferences → System recommends diet plans
   - System generates meal plans and recipes

5. **Progress Tracking**:
   - System analyzes user data → Generates visualizations
   - System awards achievements → Provides feedback

## Security Considerations

- Password hashing for user authentication
- Input validation for all API endpoints
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Data encryption for sensitive information
- Regular security audits

## Performance Optimization

- Server-side rendering for initial page load
- Client-side rendering for dynamic content
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Lazy loading for images and components
- Database indexing for frequent queries
